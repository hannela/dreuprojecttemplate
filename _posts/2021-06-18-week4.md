title: Week 4
---

This past week was full of technological frustrations. Namely, RStudio stopped working on my computer, and I spent almost three days troubleshooting, uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating before I finally got it working again.

My requests for the data I need continue to be rejected or ignored, so my project on analyzing gender disparities in upper division CS electives has mostly come to a standstill, which is disappointing. In lieu of that, Colleen and I came up with a new project for me to work on, which involves improving homework problems her team has written. It will be good coding practice, and I like editing things, so I'm looking forward to it.
