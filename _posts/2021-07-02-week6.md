title: Week 6

This week I helped out at a virtual CS summer camp run by of the CS Ed PhD students. Teaching over Zoom is awkward; most of the kids just sat silently and never asked for my help. They were using an app building tool called Thunkable, which uses puzzle piece building blocks to make code. It was kind of fun to learn, although it's the sort of thing that as a high schooler I would have found extremely boring. Some of the kids managed to build suprisingly cool apps out of the very simplistic tools they were given, which was fun to see. I was annoyed with all the camp's guest speakers, because they all focussed so much on entrepreneurship and money making, which I think are inappropriate and narrow minded things to emphasize to high schoolers.

Other than the camp, I did a little more work editing homework problems, which was refreshing because they emphasize the ways CS can be used to help people, rather than the ways CS can be used to make buttloads of money.
