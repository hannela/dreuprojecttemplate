title: Week 5
---

The past week I got sick, which really hindered my productivity. Pretty much the only thing I got done was beginning work editing the CS homework problems, which is the project I'm most excited about, and the one that most plays to my strengths. I'm working on editing a problem that has students use data about the connection between poor health and poverty. I had to learn Python to do the problem, but that was easy enough since the problem is geared towards beginnersâ€”and knowing Python, even just a little, will definitely come in handy.

One nice thing about working from home is that even though I was sick and didn't want to get out of bed, I was still able to get a little work done, propped up on my pillows.
