This week has been full of meetings and introductions. Since I don't have much to do yet and the internship is entirely virtual it hardly feels like I'm working at all. The main focus of this week has been trying to figure out what project(s) I'll spend the rest of the summer working on. 

One project I've started on is researching gender distributions in CS electives at universities. So far that has involved internet rabbit holes of public records laws and a lot of emails figuring out who to contact to get the information we need. I've also been relearning R on Codecademy so I can work on a project analyzing data about CTE spending at K-12 schools in California.

It's strange to be given so much freedom; everyone keeps telling me to pick research that's interesting to me and to take the research in my own direction if I want to, which feels very different from the prescriptive format of most of my education up to this point. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.
