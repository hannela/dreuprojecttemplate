title: Week 9

I totally forgot to write my blog last week! So, belatedly:

Last week I spent most of my time trying and mostly failing to learn how to graph in R. I can now produce graphs but they are neither visually pleasing nor particularly legible. I could really use more instruction in R; the tutorials I’ve found online have taught me the basics, but not how to code elegantly or use RStudio to its full potential, so my code is messy and wordy and convoluted, which is frustrating. In languages I understand better, my code is always neat and concise. Oh well. At least I have data and I’ll have something to show for my efforts, however ugly.
