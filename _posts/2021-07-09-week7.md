We have data!!! The person working on my request at UIUC just sent me all the data I requested from the last 10 years. And University of Texas said they should get the data to me in the next couple weeks. 

I finally can concentrate on my own project and research rather than just helping other people with theirs (and not feeling very helpful). This next week I'll mainly be cleaning up the data and doing some preliminary fiddling to see if there are any interesting patterns to guide my research questions. I only have three weeks left to get anything done, so hopefully it will all go fairly smoothly.
