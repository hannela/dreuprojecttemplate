Wow! Last blog post of the summer!

This experience has mostly been a marathon—a lot of waiting for data, a lot of little side projects. But the last couple weeks, and especially the last couple days, have been an all-out sprint. Since I got the data for my project so late, I had to spend all my time organizing and analyzing it, rather than writing my final report. So I had three days to start, polish, and finish my report—but luckily I am, if nothing else, a very competent writer, so I got it done and I'm pretty satisfied with my work.

This summer has certainly been eye-opening with regard to what grad school entails, and I've generally had a very good time. Colleen and her grad students were all very nice and fun to work with. Maybe someday I'll get to meet them in person.

Signing off,
