title: Week 7

The best thing about working remotely is that I can travel while I work. I just got back from visiting my aunt and good friend in NYC, and then spending a week visiting my two best friends in western Massachusetts. I hadn't seen my aunt in years, and it was great to be back in New York, where I lived my freshman year of college. And it was so rejuvenating to spend time with my best friends, who I hadn't seen since the start of the pandemic. They both work full time as well, so we didn't get to do anything too exciting, but it was just nice to hang around with them for a week.

In work news, I finished cleaning and categorizing the data, and started making some graphsâ€”all of which are either rudimentary or unreadable or messed up, because I realized that while I learned how to handle data frames pretty well earlier in the summer, I never really learned how to graph. I'm going to do a ggplot2 tutorial so I can make my graphs prettier and more legible. Thus far, I have learned to make basic bar graphs, which confirmed my hypothesis that female students have a slight preference toward working with female professors for independent study and thesis work. I think a lot of what this data will reveal is pretty predictable, but I guess that's often the nature of research.
