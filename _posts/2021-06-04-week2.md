title: Week 2

I've started settling into more of a pattern this week. I have a meeting or two most days, some with my mentor Colleen, some with the graduate student I'm working with, Mariam, and some I just sit in on but am not involved in. When I'm not in meetings, I've been playing around with R and trying to figure out how to get universities to share their data with me.

I think college has got me accustomed to being constantly a little overworked; by the end of each semester I'm always completely burnt out—so I'm always sort of surprised when I don't have constant work. I've been getting a lot done, I think, but I still have plenty of time to take care of myself and do other things I enjoy. It feels very... sustainable. I still find myself getting a little anxious when I'm not getting work done, but I've realized that I'm much more productive in short bursts.

It seems like UIUC will actually give me the data I need to work on the project Colleen and I came up with, which is exciting. I don't mind helping Mariam with her project, and I think it's very interesting, but sometimes I feel like I'm a little underfoot—it would be nice to have a project of my own to work on.
